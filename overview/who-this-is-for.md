# Who This Is For

This work is primarily for people who have responsibility for software that must keep working.

That includes:

- experienced developers maintaining long-lived systems
- technical leads and architects
- engineers uneasy about AI touching production code
- students thinking about how to develop durable skills in an AI-shaped industry

You do not need to agree with the ideas here to find value in them.
You do need to care about change, risk, and long-term consequences.

This is not written for people looking for a new framework to adopt wholesale.
It is written for people who recognise that something fundamental is shifting and want language and tools to think clearly about it.

If you have ever felt that:
- change feels riskier than it should
- important constraints live only in people’s heads
- automation moves faster than understanding

then this work is meant to be useful to you.
