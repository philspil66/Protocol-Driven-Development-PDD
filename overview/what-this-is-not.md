# What This Is Not

This repository is not a finished framework or methodology.

It does not aim to replace existing practices such as Agile, Scrum, Kanban, TDD, or DDD.
It does not prescribe a single way of working.
It does not claim universal applicability.

It is also not a product, a platform, or a set of tools.

The ideas here are intentionally small, local, and composable.
They are meant to sit alongside existing ways of working, not overwrite them.

Most importantly, this is not a set of rules to follow blindly.

Everything here is subject to revision.
Some ideas will fail.
Some will turn out to be context-dependent.

That uncertainty is part of the work, not a flaw to be eliminated.
