# Protocol Driven Development (PDD)

This repository is a working notebook.

It documents an ongoing exploration into how we make software change safer, clearer, and more intentional when AI-assisted tools are part of the development loop.

The focus is not on writing code faster.  
It is on governing change responsibly.

This repo contains patterns, examples, field notes, and unfinished thinking gathered while applying these ideas to real systems.

It is intentionally incomplete.

---

## What this is

This is a place to capture:

- emerging patterns for governing change
- lightweight protocols embedded close to code
- examples of how AI tools behave in the presence of explicit rules
- field notes from real experiments
- ideas that worked
- ideas that failed
- ideas that are still unclear

The material here is shaped by practice, not theory.

---

## What this is not

This is not:

- a finished framework
- a methodology to adopt wholesale
- a replacement for Agile, Scrum, Kanban, TDD, or DDD
- a set of universal rules
- a product

Think of this as a lab notebook that happens to be public.

## Why this exists

As AI tools move from being code generators to active maintainers, the central question shifts:

How do we make change safe when a machine is part of the loop?

Much of today’s tooling optimises for speed.  
This work explores how we encode intent, constraints, and risk so that both humans and AI can act with care.

## How to read this repository

If you are new here:

1. Start with `/overview/what-this-is.md`
2. Skim the `/patterns` directory to see what has stabilised
3. Read the `/field-notes` to see what actually happened in practice
4. Browse `/thoughts` for unfinished ideas and feedback

Not everything here is correct.  
Everything here is honest.

## Project status

This project is exploratory and evolving.

Patterns may change.  
Ideas may be removed.  
Language may be refined.

Dates are preserved deliberately to show how the thinking evolves over time.

---

## Relationship to AI tools

These ideas have been tested primarily with AI-assisted development tools such as Cursor and Copilot.

The goal is not to control AI, but to give it clear boundaries so it can collaborate safely.

---

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome, especially:

- real-world examples
- critiques and failure cases
- alternative protocol designs
- observations about AI behaviour

Practical experience matters more than theory.

---

## Philosophy

A simple belief underpins this work:

The future of software is not about writing code faster.  
It is about changing systems safely.

Protocols help make that possible.
